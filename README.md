# CalculatorEcuatiiComplexe
This calculator supports complex equations such as:
[40+(5-1)]*2 will return 88
5 / 0 will warn the user 
[(2*3)^2]/4-(6+2)#3, where x^y means x to the power of y and x#y means x square root of y, will return 7
2 * 3.2 will return 6.4
24342343.0002-3 will return  24342340.0002
2 *    3 - 8 will return -2

it can also process even more complex equations such as:
[(3-3) * (2-3)] will display 0
(0.425.242 ^ 7) will warn the user with an error (invalid input)
[(2^6)^4 / 2^3*(2^6+2^6)-4^6 / 2^10] / (2^28-2^2)+9 will display 10
[(100000.2 * 1.12) ^ (1.23 + 0.298)] # [(99999 / 3.3) - (1.9754 - 4.162673761)] will display 1.0005 

The calculator also supports command line arguments and can be called like:
oop.exe [4+(5-1)]*2
